      <p><strong>Carnival is one of ten cruise lines owned by the world's largest cruise ship operator, the
          American-British Carnival Corporation & plc. In 2021, Carnival Cruise Line was estimated to hold a 7.6% share
          of cruise industry revenue and 18.2% of passengers</strong>
        It has 24 vessels and is the largest fleet in the Carnival group <em>Albert.</em></p>

      <p> The ships fly flags of convenience: 18 of the ships fly the Panama flag and six that of the Bahamas. Its
        headquarters are in Miami, Florida, United States. The North American division of Carnival Corporation has
        executive control over the corporation and is headquartered in Doral, Florida. </p>

      <p> Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 by Ted Arison. To finance the venture, Arison turned to his friend
        Meshulam Riklis, who owned Boston-based American International Travel Service (AITS). Arison and Riklis set up
        the new company as a subsidiary of AITS.</p>

      <h3>History</h3>

      <p> Carnival Cruise Line commenced sailings from Miami with their first ship the Mardi Gras in 1972, a former
        transatlantic liner purchased from Canadian Pacific Line. Carnival would adapt and evolve the green Canadian
        Pacific livery for their new logo, changing the colors to red, white and blue as seen today.</p>

      <blockquote> In 1975, Carnival acquired another former Canadian Pacific Line ship, renaming it the Carnivale.[7]
        The success of the two ships led to the acquisition of their third ship in 1978, the TSS Festivale, another
        former ocean liner. With the success of the three ships, Carnival decided to build new ships to be able to
        compete with the rival Miami cruise lines."

      <h4> Covid effects on crusing</h4>

      <p> In a filing with regulators, the company stated that as of July 31, 2020, it had $7.9 billion in "cash and
        cash equivalent" available. An industry news item estimated that this would enable Carnival to continue
        operating for roughly a year in a situation where none of the ships was sailing.

      <h4> Controversy</h4>

      <p> In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, three of the Carnival cruise ships were chartered by the United States
        government for six months to serve as temporary housing until the houses can be rebuilt. After being chartered
        for six months, their planned voyages were cancelled, and passengers were refunded.
